# DFT computations

-This directory contains a sample batch script "samplejob.inp" to execute a parallelized ORCA computation as carried out in the paper. Please note that exact directory paths (such as openmpi path) are system dependent. We strongly suggest following the guide available on https://nbo7.chem.wisc.edu/ to properly install nbo.

-The file titled "samplejob.inp" contains exactly the configurations we used for all ORCA computations performed. In addition the PubChem CID of each molecule was included as a comment to allow for quick identification of the corresponding molecule.

-Please make sure you use the same NBO and ORCA versions as described in the samplejob.inp file to replicate our results.
