# model outputs

-This directory contains a sample of bmodel output. The only file needed to reproduce the results contained in this directory is the "trreacts48" file. In this case "hybridttreacts48-4000.txt", which contains the predictions used for the reaction samples provided in the paper. 

-Other files in this subdirectory are not needed and were only included to exemplify the output of the bmodel.py script.
