# random forest model outputs

-This directory contains a example of rfcrossval.py output. each csv file contains the performance report from the corresponding fold, from f0 to f4. The model also outputs a reports.pt file containing the dataframes and top-3 accuracies for each random forest tested.

-The rf performance reports included in the Supporting Information are generated by parsing the .csv and .pt files of the form "prefix"+"rftrees" + ".csv (or .pt)" using the ./utils/parsing/cvmetrics.py script which is also used for parsing fnn model results.
